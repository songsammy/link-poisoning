An attempt to attack some p2p tools.   
Download demo:   
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/songsammy/link-poisoning/master/Test.txt   
If you click the url from a web browser, then you will get a 404.
However, if you download it with a p2p tool, then you will get a fake file.
As this is just a test, there's no virus in the file(just a txt file).
however, it proved that the attack is possible.
